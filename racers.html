               <div class="about">
                <p>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver. <br> He currently competes in Formula One for Mercedes, having previously driven for McLaren from 2007 to 2012. <br> In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers'<br> Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (103), and podium finishes (183), among others.

                    Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, <br> Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. <br> This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren in 2007, making Hamilton the first, and so far only, <br> black driver to race in the series. That season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. <br> The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. <br>  After four more years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.</p>

                <p>Daniel Joseph Ricciardo AM (/rɪˈkɑːrdoʊ/ "Ricardo"; born 1 July 1989) is an Italian-Australian[2] racing driver who is currently competing in the 2022 FIA Formula One World Drivers Championship driving for the McLaren Formula One team, under the Australian flag. He made his debut at the 2011 British Grand Prix with the HRT team as part of a deal with Red Bull Racing, for whom he was test driving under its sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso. Ricciardo's driver number is 3. He has achieved 8 Grand Prix victories in Formula One.

                    Ricciardo joined Toro Rosso in 2012 full-time after the team changed its driver lineup and drove a Ferrari-powered car for them in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, Ricciardo was promoted to Red Bull as a replacement for the retired Mark Webber alongside multiple time world champion Sebastian Vettel.[3] In his first season with Red Bull under Renault power, Ricciardo finished third in the championship with his first three Formula One wins, in Canada,[4] Hungary,[5] and Belgium.[6] After two years without a victory, Ricciardo returned to the top of the podium at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix, eventually sealing third in the championship for the second time in three years at the 2016 Mexican Grand Prix.[7][8] He has since added victories for Red Bull at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017 and the Chinese and Monaco Grands Prix in 2018. After 2018, Ricciardo signed with Renault and raced for them in the 2019 and 2020 seasons. He joined McLaren for the 2021 and 2022 Formula One seasons, alongside Lando Norris. He obtained his first race win with McLaren at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix. After the 2021 season, Ricciardo was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Australia Day Honours.[9]</p>
