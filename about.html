                <h1>OUR JOURNEY</h1>
            <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international <br> racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). <br> The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, <br> has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. <br> The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races, <br> known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.</p>

                <h1>Formula One story</h1>
                <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of the 1920s and 1930s. <br> The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must meet. <br> Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place that year. <br> The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing organisations <br> had laid out rules for a world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, <br> the World Drivers' Championship did not become formalised until 1947. <br> The first world championship race took place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. <br> Giuseppe Farina, in his Alfa Romeo, won the first World Championship for Drivers in 1950, <br> narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood for 45 years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.</p>
